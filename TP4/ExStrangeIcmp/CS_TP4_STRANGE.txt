=======================================================
1. What is the IP address of the attacker's machine?

R: 172.16.226.130

-------------------------------------------------------

2. Was the attack from an:

R: Internal endpoint

-------------------------------------------------------

3. What tool was used for the reconnaissance activity?

R: nmap

-------------------------------------------------------

4. How many TCP ports were scanned during the reconnaissance phase?

R: 1000

-------------------------------------------------------

5. Why is a UDP scan harder to detect than a TCP SYN scan?

R: UDP does not establish a connection, generating fewer logs

-------------------------------------------------------

6. After the scanning phase, the attacker sent data using ICMP packets.
How many ICMP echo request packets contain data payloads?

R: 21

-------------------------------------------------------

7. Extract the first flag hidden in the ICMP traffic (Format: ISELCTF{...})

R: ISELCTF{1stOneCheck!}

-------------------------------------------------------

8. A second flag was exfiltrated using ICMP packets, but it was fragmented across multiple packets. 
Reconstruct the complete flag(Format: ISELCTF{...})

R: ISELCTF{N1c30n3}

-------------------------------------------------------

9. What was the correct sequence of attack activities?

R: Discovery scan -> TCP scan -> Udp scan -> ICMP exfiltration

-------------------------------------------------------

10. Select the TRUE statements about using ICMP for data exfiltration:

R:
- ICMP is frequently allowed in firewalls for network troubleshooting
  
- Many IDS do not inspect ICMP packet payloads

-------------------------------------------------------

11. Indicate which of the following measures can detect or prevent ICMP exfiltration:

R:
- Block all outbound ICMP traffic

- Inspect ICMP payload sizes

- Implement rate limiting on ICMP packets

- Analyze anomalous patterns in ICMP traffic
