    what is JWT:

        open standard RFC 7519 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
        
            Abstract

            JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing
            claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT
            are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON
            Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web
            Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally
            signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code
            (MAC) and/or encrypted.

        From JWT site (https://www.jwt.io/introduction#what-is-json-web-token)

            JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact
            and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties
            as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is
            digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm)
            or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
            Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we 
            will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims
            contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. 
            When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies
            that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.


    Uso de passwords hardcoded:

        public static final String PASSWORD
            ("/JWT/refresh/login")
                public ResponseEntity follow
        PASSWORD -> 
            usado para comparar a com a password enviada pelo utilizador para o endpoint /JWT/refresh/login

        ------
        private static final String JWT_PASSWORD
            ("/JWT/refresh/login")
                public ResponseEntity follow
                    private Map<String, Object> createNewTokens
            JWT_PASSWORD -> used here to sign the new token created

            ("/JWT/refresh/checkout")
                public ResponseEntity<AttackResult> checkout
            JWT_PASSWORD -> used here to verify the signature of the token sent by the user
            
            ("/JWT/refresh/newToken")
                public ResponseEntity newToken
            JWT_PASSWORD -> used here to verify the signature of the token sent by the user
